Four years later, 88 students of the first batch

spacious library, a complete laboratory, HE room, Audio
Visual room, HRM Housekeeping rooms, mini hotel and front
service amenities, college office and several administrative
offices that includes the president's office, Human Resource
and Management Office, principal's offices and a registrar

the students were systematized. They include the Medical and
Dental Clinic,
Guidance Library Science Business Laboratories, Computer Lab., HELE Practice House,
Workshop. Bus Service and Canteen. The School is accessible
to all types of transportations.
The institutional administration was organized under
the leadership of Mr. Alfredo Demetillo as president of the
Board of Trustees. He is ably assisted by the Directress Dr.
