<h2>Why is STEM Important? Why Do We Keep Talking About it?</h2></center>
<p>When we refer to STEM, it's not just coding and lab coats. It's the underpinning of manufacturing, food production, health care, and so much more that frankly, we might take for granted, but surely can't live without.
<p>STEM is important because our world depends on it. The economy, our general well-being it's all backed by science, technology, engineering, and math.</p>
<h2>What is STEM Strand?</h2>
<p>STEM is an approach to learning and development that integrates the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Through STEM, students develop key skills including: problem solving.
<p>STEM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in four specific disciplines science, technology, engineering and mathematics in an interdisciplinary and applied approach. Rather than teach the four disciplines as separate and discrete subjects, STEM integrates them into a cohesive learning paradigm based on real-world applications.</p>
<h2>STEM and Beyond: Careers for STEM Graduates</h2>
<P>Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs open the door to many different careers, including opportunities in engineering, science, and research. STEM professionals can explore diverse fields like aeronautics and biochemistry. Some STEM students also apply their technical knowledge in law, politics, and education.
