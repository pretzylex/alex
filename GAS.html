<h2>What is GAS Strand?</h2>
<p>GAS is a Senior High School strand that takes on a generalist approach in preparing students for college. It covers various disciplines like Humanities, Social Sciences, Organization, and Management.
Unlike ABM and HUMSS strands that are designed for specific disciplines, the General Academic Strand (GAS) is designed for those who are undecided in their career goals. In GAS, students will take different elective subjects coming from different disciplines to give them a taste of how it feels to be both businessmen and social scientists or writers.  GAS offers a combination of ABM and HUMSS electives. Students will experience the quality of business instructions and at the same time learn creativity and ingenuity.
